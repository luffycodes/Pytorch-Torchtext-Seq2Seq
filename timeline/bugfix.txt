1. Same loss for everything
    - How to resolve?
        - check weights
        - check biases
        - check initialization of weights
        - batch size increase
        - print norm of weights
2. Preprocessing may be wrong
    - No use of spacy german or french model
3. Tools
    - Ipython
    - Python debugger
